# The `<div>` Epidemic: Code Examples

This repository contains all the code examples from my LinkedIn article, **"From `<div>` Hell to SEO Heaven: Why Your Frontend Choices Can Make or Break Your Business"**.

The goal of these examples is to visually demonstrate the difference between non-semantic (`<div>`-based) code and best-practice semantic HTML. You'll find three versions for each UI component:

1.  **The `<div>` Nightmare:** A non-semantic approach that lacks accessibility and is difficult to maintain.
2.  **The `<div>` with a Life Vest:** A partial fix using ARIA attributes to improve accessibility.
3.  **The Best Practice:** A clean, semantic, and accessible solution.
